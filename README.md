# VALE BPF Extention Module
VALE-BPF module is an extention of VALE software switch.

This module makes VALE possible to program with eBPF.

## Supported Platforms
- Linux
- FreeBSD

## Requirements
- generic-ebpf (https://github.com/YutaroHayakawa/generic-ebpf.git)
- clang-3.7 or later (for compilation of C â†’ eBPF program)
- netmap (https://github.com/luigirizzo/netmap.git)

## Installation

### Install netmap

```
$ git clone https://github.com/luigirizzo/netmap.git
$ cd netmap
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install
```

Create switch named vale0 and attach two interfaces

```
# vale-ctl -n vi0 //interface 0
# vale-ctl -n vi1 //interface 1
# vale-ctl -a vale0:vi0 //attach interface 0 to vale0
# vale-ctl -a vale0:vi1 //attach interface 1 to vale0
```

### Install generic-ebpf

#### FreeBSD

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YutaroHayakawa/generic-ebpf.git
$ cd generic-ebpf/FreeBSD/kernel
$ make
# kldload ./ebpf.ko
```

#### Linux

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YutaroHayakawa/generic-ebpf.git
$ cd generic-ebpf/LINUX/kernel
$ make
# insmod ebpf.ko
```

### Install vale-bpf

#### FreeBSD

```
$ export NSRC=<path to your netmap source>
$ export EBPFSRC=<path to your generic-ebpf source>
$ export VALE_NAME=vale0
$ git clone https://github.com/YutaroHayakawa/vale-bpf.git
$ cd vale-bpf/sys/modules
$ make
$ kldload ./vale-bpf-vale0.ko
```

#### Linux
```
$ export NSRC=<path to your netmap source>
$ export EBPFSRC=<path to your generic-ebpf source>
$ export VALE_NAME=vale0
$ git clone https://github.com/YutaroHayakawa/vale-bpf.git
$ cd vale-bpf/LINUX
$ make
$ insmod ./vale-bpf-vale0.ko
```

### Loading eBPF program
Now module is loaded to vale0. However, eBPF program is not yet loaded.
You need to load eBPF program. For that, you can use apps/prog-loader/prog-loader.c

```
$ cd apps/prog-loader
$ make
$ ./prog-loader -s vale0: -p <path to your own eBPF program> -j(enable this flag if you want to use jit)
```

Some example eBPF programs are available in apps/ebpf\_example. Please feel free to
use that.

## Experimental Linux native eBPF support

We have experimental support for Linux's native eBPF. Unlike our generic-ebpf, it can be integrated with
other Linux's eBPF functionality like map, tail-call or object pinning and even with bcc toolchains.
However, you need to modify kernel for using this. We currently only tested this for Linux-4.12. If you
tested this with other virsions of kernel, please share your result :)

### Installing modified kernel
```
$ wget https://github.com/YutaroHayakawa/linux/archive/v4.12-vale-bpf.zip
$ unzip v4.12-vale-bpf.zip
$ cd linux-4.12-vale-bpf
```

Now, please configure kernel as you like, but please enable eBPF related options.
Note that if you want to use phisical NICs in netmap, you need to install NIC drivers
as module.

After configuration, compile kernel and modules.

```
$ make bzImage && make modules
# make modules\_install && make headers\_install && make install
# reboot now
```

### Installing your eBPF program
